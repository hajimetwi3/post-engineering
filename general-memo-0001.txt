Sometimes when we want to look at something more clearly, a few small habits
can make the whole picture easier to understand.

For example, it can help to momentarily set aside the different kinds of bias
we all carry around, such as authority bias, organizational bias, context
bias, halo effects, in-group bias, self-justification bias, or impressions
from the past.

It can also make a difference to pause any personal feelings, whether positive
or negative, toward the people involved and look only at the content itself.

And sometimes it is useful to gently reset your own assumptions for a moment
to see things from a more neutral starting point.

Small shifts like these often make analysis surprisingly clearer. If any part
of this feels helpful, feel free to keep it in mind whenever you like.
